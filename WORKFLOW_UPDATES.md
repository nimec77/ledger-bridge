# Workflow.md Updates Summary

## Overview
The `doc/workflow.md` has been updated to align with the new iteration-based tasklist and format-specific struct architecture.

---

## Key Updates

### 1. **Terminology Changes**

**Before:** Phase-based language
**After:** Iteration-based language

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| Phase 0.1 | Iteration 0, Task 0.1 |
| "current phase" | "current iteration" |
| "Phase X.Y" | "Iteration X, Task X.Y" |
| Phase progress | Iteration task counters |

---

### 2. **Architecture Alignment**

#### Updated Code Examples

**Before (Generic Traits):**
```rust
struct CsvParser;

impl Parser<Statement> for CsvParser {
    type Error = ParseError;
    fn parse<R: BufRead>(&self, reader: R) -> Result<Statement, Self::Error> {
        // ...
    }
}
```

**After (Format-Specific Structs):**
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct CsvStatement {
    pub account_number: String,
    pub currency: String,
    // ... identical fields to Mt940/Camt053
}

impl CsvStatement {
    pub fn from_read<R: std::io::Read>(reader: &mut R) -> Result<Self, ParseError> {
        // Use csv::Reader::from_reader()
    }
    
    pub fn write_to<W: std::io::Write>(&self, writer: &mut W) -> Result<(), ParseError> {
        // Use csv::Writer::from_writer()
    }
}
```

---

### 3. **Step 1: Before Starting Work**

**Added:**
- Check testable output criteria for iteration
- Identify pending tasks in current iteration

**Emphasizes:**
- Iteration-focused workflow
- Clear success criteria upfront

---

### 4. **Step 2: Propose Solution**

**Updated Example:**
```
📋 Iteration 2, Task 2.1: Create CsvStatement struct

🎯 Approach:
Define CsvStatement with fields identical to Mt940/Camt053 for simple From trait conversions.

💻 Code Structure:
[Shows actual struct with from_read/write_to methods]

❓ Agree to proceed with this structure?
```

**Key Changes:**
- Uses struct definitions (not parsers)
- Shows from_read/write_to methods (not parse/format)
- References From trait conversions
- Mentions specific libraries (csv crate)

---

### 5. **Step 5: Update Progress**

**Enhanced Progress Tracking:**

**Before:**
- Mark completed subtasks
- Update phase progress counters
- Update status

**After:**
- Mark completed tasks: `- [x]` → `- [X]` (capital X for clarity)
- Update iteration task counters: "0/4" → "1/4"
- Update iteration status: ⏳ → 🔄 → ✅
- **Update overall progress percentage** (new requirement)

---

### 6. **Step 7: Commit Changes**

**Changed:** Made optional (not required every time)

**Before:**
```
Phase X.Y: [Description]
```

**After:**
```
Iteration X, Task X.Y: [Description]

- Implemented [feature]
- Added tests for [functionality]
- Tests passing: build, test, clippy
- Updated tasklist progress
```

---

### 7. **Step 8: Move to Next Task**

**Added:**
- Complete all tasks in current iteration before moving to next
- Emphasizes completing entire iteration

**Before:** "Get explicit agreement to proceed to next subtask"
**After:** "Complete all tasks in current iteration before moving to next"

---

### 8. **Communication Format**

#### When Proposing

**Updated Format:**
```
📋 Iteration X, Task X.Y: [Task name]

🎯 Approach:
[Brief explanation of what will be implemented]

💻 Code Structure:
[Key struct definitions, method signatures, snippets]

🧪 Tests:
[What will be tested and how]

❓ Agree to proceed?
```

**Changes:**
- Iteration and Task numbers
- "Code Structure" instead of just "Code"
- More explicit test descriptions

#### When Complete

**Updated Format:**
```
✅ Completed: Iteration X, Task X.Y - [Task name]

📝 Changes:
- [List of files created/modified]
- [List of functionality added]

🧪 Test Results:
✓ cargo build: PASS
✓ cargo test: PASS (X tests)
✓ cargo clippy: PASS (no warnings)
✓ cargo fmt: Code formatted

📊 Progress: Updated tasklist (Iteration X: Y/Z tasks complete)

⏸️  Awaiting confirmation to proceed
```

**Changes:**
- More detailed test results (counts, formatting)
- Explicit progress update mention
- "Awaiting confirmation to proceed" (clearer)

---

### 9. **Example Session**

**Complete Rewrite:**

**Shows:**
1. Proper iteration/task numbering
2. Workspace setup with all dependencies (serde, csv, quick-xml)
3. Cargo.toml structures for both crates
4. Task-by-task progression
5. Progress tracking updates
6. Approval checkpoints

**Demonstrates:**
```
Assistant proposes → User approves → Assistant implements → 
Shows results → User confirms → Move to next task
```

**Key Details:**
- Shows resolver = "2" in workspace
- Shows edition = "2021"
- Shows all required dependencies with versions
- Shows task counter updates: "1/2 tasks complete"

---

### 10. **NEW: Iteration Completion Section**

**Completely New Addition:**

```markdown
## Iteration Completion

### Before Moving to Next Iteration
Each iteration has specific **Testable Output** criteria in tasklist.md.

**Verify all criteria met:**
- [ ] All tasks in iteration completed and checked
- [ ] Test command from tasklist runs successfully
- [ ] Expected functionality demonstrated
- [ ] Progress table updated
- [ ] User confirms iteration complete

Only proceed to next iteration after:
✅ All tests passing
✅ Functionality demonstrated
✅ User approval received
```

**Purpose:**
- Ensures iterations are truly complete
- References testable output from tasklist
- Prevents premature progression
- Clear checklist format

**Example Provided:**
Shows Iteration 2 (CSV) testable criteria:
1. Parse CSV string into CsvStatement
2. Write CsvStatement back to CSV
3. Round-trip works

---

### 11. **Quick Reference Updates**

**Added Row:**
```
| Before next iteration | Verify all criteria + get approval | ✋ YES |
```

**New Key Principles Section:**
- **Propose first** - Always show code before implementing
- **Test everything** - build, test, clippy must pass
- **Update progress** - Keep tasklist.md current
- **Wait at checkpoints** - Don't skip ahead without approval
- **One iteration at a time** - Complete fully before moving on

---

## Workflow Enforcement

### Strict Checkpoints

The updated workflow enforces **4 wait points:**

1. ✋ **Before coding** - Propose solution with code snippets
2. ✋ **After implementation** - Show test results
3. ✋ **Before next task** - Get approval
4. ✋ **Before next iteration** - Verify all criteria + approval

### Progress Tracking

**Must Update:**
- Task checkboxes (- [X])
- Task counters (X/Y format)
- Iteration status (⏳ 🔄 ✅)
- Overall progress percentage

**In tasklist.md progress table.**

---

## Architecture References

### Correctly References:

✅ **Format-specific structs** - CsvStatement, Mt940, Camt053
✅ **Methods** - from_read(), write_to()
✅ **Traits** - Read/Write for I/O, From for conversions
✅ **Libraries** - csv, quick-xml with versions
✅ **Shared types** - Transaction, BalanceType, TransactionType
✅ **Error type** - ParseError

### No Longer References:

❌ Generic Parser<T>/Formatter<T> traits
❌ Zero-sized parser structs
❌ BufRead trait (now just Read)
❌ parse()/format() methods
❌ Phase-based organization

---

## Document Quality

### Metrics

- **Before:** 249 lines
- **After:** 320 lines
- **Change:** +71 lines

**Why Longer:**
- Added Iteration Completion section (new)
- More detailed code examples (format-specific structs)
- More explicit test result formatting
- Added Key Principles section
- Better example session with full details

**Still Concise:**
- Only essential workflow steps
- No duplicate information
- Clear checkpoints
- KISS principle maintained

### Structure

1. ✅ Workflow Rules (8 steps)
2. ✅ Task Execution Pattern (flowchart)
3. ✅ Critical Requirements (must/must not)
4. ✅ Communication Format (templates)
5. ✅ Example Session (realistic)
6. ✅ Iteration Completion (NEW)
7. ✅ Quick Reference (checkpoints + principles)

---

## Usage for Code Assistant

### Clear Instructions For:

1. **When to propose** - Before any coding
2. **What to include** - Code snippets, struct definitions, test plans
3. **When to wait** - 4 explicit checkpoints
4. **How to update progress** - Specific format for tasklist
5. **When iteration is complete** - Testable criteria checklist
6. **How to communicate** - Structured format with emojis
7. **What to test** - build, test, clippy, fmt

### Prevents:

❌ Implementing without proposal
❌ Skipping ahead without approval
❌ Missing progress updates
❌ Incomplete iterations
❌ Using old architecture (generic traits)
❌ Wrong method names (parse/format)

---
