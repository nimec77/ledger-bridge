# Conventions.md Updates Summary

## Overview
The `conventions.md` file has been updated to reflect the new architecture from `vision.md` while maintaining conciseness and following the KISS principle.

---

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Code Organization** (Lines 7-21)

**Before:**
- Referenced generic Parser/Formatter traits
- Included `traits.rs` file in layout

**After:**
- References format-specific structs with methods
- Layout now shows `formats/*.rs` containing structs with `from_read()`, `write_to()`, and `From` implementations
- Removed `traits.rs` from file layout (no longer needed)

**Updated File Layout:**
```
lib.rs        → Public API exports, module declarations
model.rs      → Shared types (Transaction, BalanceType, TransactionType)
error.rs      → Error types with Display + Error traits
formats/*.rs  → Format-specific structs (Mt940, Camt053, CsvStatement) with methods
```

---

### 2. **Trait Implementation → Format Implementation** (Lines 42-74)

**Before:** Section titled "Trait Implementation"
- Described Parser and Formatter traits
- Generic over type `T`
- Used `BufRead` for parsing

**After:** Section titled "Format Implementation"
- Describes required methods for each format struct
- Shows `from_read()` and `write_to()` pattern
- Includes `From` trait implementation example

**New Implementation Pattern:**
```rust
impl Mt940 {
    pub fn from_read<R: std::io::Read>(reader: &mut R) -> Result<Self, ParseError>
    pub fn write_to<W: std::io::Write>(&self, writer: &mut W) -> Result<(), ParseError>
}

impl From<Camt053> for Mt940 {
    fn from(camt: Camt053) -> Self { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

### 3. **Data Structures** (Lines 91-96)

**Before:**
- Mentioned "zero-sized types for parsers/formatters"

**After:**
- Removed zero-sized types reference
- Added: "Format structs have identical field structure"
- Added: "Shared types (Transaction, BalanceType) used across all formats"

This reflects the new architecture where formats are distinct structs with data fields, not empty parser/formatter types.

---

### 4. **Documentation Style** (Lines 100-135)

**Before:**
- Example showed `CsvParser` (zero-sized type)
- Used `BufReader` and `parse()` method

**After:**
- Example shows `CsvStatement` struct with fields
- Uses direct `from_read()` method
- Shows struct definition with derive macros

**Updated Example:**
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct CsvStatement {
    pub account_number: String,
    // ... fields
}

impl CsvStatement {
    /// Parse CSV from any Read source.
    pub fn from_read<R: std::io::Read>(reader: &mut R) -> Result<Self, ParseError>
}
```

---

### 5. **Testing** (Lines 139-178)

**Before:**
- Tested parsers and formatters
- Used `BufReader` wrapper
- Called `CsvParser.parse(reader)`

**After:**
- Tests `from_read()` and `write_to()` methods
- Tests `From` trait conversions
- Direct byte slice usage without BufReader

**Updated Test Examples:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_parse_csv() {
    let mut reader = input.as_bytes();
    let result = CsvStatement::from_read(&mut reader);
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}

#[test]
fn test_write_csv() {
    let mut output = Vec::new();
    let result = statement.write_to(&mut output);
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}

#[test]
fn test_conversion() {
    let mt940 = Mt940 { /* ... */ };
    let camt053: Camt053 = mt940.into();
    assert_eq!(camt053.account_number, "...");
}
```

---

### 6. **Dependencies** (Lines 182-198)

**Before:**
- Listed as "optional" helpers
- General dependency rules

**After:**
- Explicitly lists required libraries with versions and trust scores
- Clear parsing approach for each format
- Emphasizes Read/Write trait support

**Updated Dependencies:**
```
Required Libraries:
- serde (with derive feature)
- csv (v1.3) - Trust Score: 9.1
- quick-xml (v0.31) - Trust Score: 9.2
- clap (CLI only)

Parsing Approach:
- CSV: Use csv crate
- MT940: Manual parsing (educational)
- CAMT.053: Use quick-xml
```

---

### 7. **I/O Patterns** (Lines 219-236)

**Before:**
- Mentioned both `BufRead` and `Read`
- Discussed wrapping with BufReader
- Formatters return strings

**After:**
- **Only Read trait** for input
- **Only Write trait** for output
- Explicit benefits section explaining advantage

**Key Changes:**
- `&mut R where R: std::io::Read` (not BufRead)
- `&mut W where W: std::io::Write` (not returning String)
- Listed supported sources: files, stdin, buffers, network

**Benefits Added:**
- Single implementation works with any Read/Write source
- No code duplication
- Demonstrates standard library trait power

---

### 8. **Naming Conventions** (Lines 240-255)

**Before:**
```
Types: CsvParser, Mt940Parser, Camt053Parser
Methods: parse(), format()
Variables: statement, output
```

**After:**
```
Types: Mt940, Camt053, CsvStatement
Methods: from_read(), write_to()
Variables: mt940, camt053, csv_statement, reader, writer
```

This reflects format structs as distinct types rather than parser/formatter utilities.

---

### 9. **Learning Focus** (Lines 292-305)

**Before:**
1. Understand trait-based polymorphism
2. Standard library I/O patterns (BufRead, Read, Write)
3. Error handling
4. Type conversions

**After:**
1. **Standard library I/O traits** (Read and Write - primary focus)
2. **Type conversions with From trait** (new emphasis)
3. **Static polymorphism** (compile-time optimization)
4. Error handling
5. **Practical parsing** (using appropriate libraries)

**Key Shift:** From "trait-based polymorphism" to "standard library I/O traits and From conversions"

---

## Sections Unchanged

The following sections remain largely the same as they're architecture-agnostic:

✅ **Error Handling** - Still emphasizes no unwrap/expect, Result types, ParseError
✅ **Code Style** - Explicitness and simplicity principles unchanged
✅ **Anti-Patterns** - Forbidden practices remain the same
✅ **Version Control** - Git workflow unchanged
✅ **CLI Guidelines** - Still uses clap, handles stdin/stdout
✅ **Summary** - KISS principle maintained

---

## Alignment with Vision.md

The updated `conventions.md` now perfectly aligns with `vision.md`:

✅ **Read/Write traits** emphasized throughout
✅ **Format-specific structs** (Mt940, Camt053, CsvStatement) consistently referenced
✅ **From trait conversions** included in implementation patterns
✅ **Third-party libraries** explicitly listed with versions
✅ **No generic Parser/Formatter traits** mentioned
✅ **Examples updated** to show new API pattern
✅ **Learning objectives** match vision.md focus

---

## Document Quality

### Conciseness
- **Before:** 270 lines
- **After:** 320 lines (+50 lines)
- Additional lines due to more complete examples (From trait, write_to tests)
- Still concise - only essential rules

### KISS Principle
✅ Clear structure maintained
✅ No unnecessary details
✅ References vision.md for complete specs
✅ Essential rules that impact code quality

### Reference Strategy
✅ Opens with: "See [@vision.md](vision.md) for complete technical blueprint"
✅ Closes with: "Reference [@vision.md](vision.md) for detailed specifications"
✅ Doesn't duplicate vision.md content
✅ Provides quick-reference patterns

---

## Key Improvements

1. **Architectural Clarity** - Clear distinction between format structs vs shared types
2. **Method Signatures** - Explicit `from_read()` and `write_to()` patterns
3. **I/O Trait Focus** - Strong emphasis on Read/Write benefits
4. **Practical Examples** - All code examples updated to new API
5. **Library Integration** - Clear guidance on using csv/quick-xml
6. **Type Safety** - From trait conversions for compile-time safety

---

## Usage for Code Assistant

This updated `conventions.md` provides a code assistant with:

✅ **Clear API patterns** - How to structure format implementations
✅ **Required methods** - What each format struct must implement
✅ **Error handling rules** - Critical no-panic requirements
✅ **Testing patterns** - How to test from_read/write_to/conversions
✅ **Library usage** - Which crates to use for which formats
✅ **Naming conventions** - Consistent naming across the codebase
✅ **Learning objectives** - Why certain patterns are used

The assistant can now generate code that:
- Uses Read/Write traits properly
- Implements format structs with correct methods
- Includes From trait conversions
- Uses appropriate external libraries
- Follows error handling rules strictly
